# 🌳 VI. DP on Trees

> 🧠 "Dynamic Programming on Trees teaches us how to solve problems by solving subtrees first — mastering it means mastering recursion itself."

| 🚩 # | 🤩 Problem Name             | 🧠 Technique           | 🔗 Problem Link                                                              | ⏱️ Status   |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 32   | Diameter of Binary Tree     | DFS + Tree DP (Height) | [Leetcode #543](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)      | ✅ Completed |
| 33   | Max Path Sum (Node to Node) | DFS + Global Max Track | [Leetcode #124](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/) | ✅ Completed |

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/dp-series.git
$ cd dp-series

# Compile and run a specific file
$ g++ 33-max-path-sum-node-to-node.cpp -o run
$ ./run
```

You can go step-by-step through each file to understand:
✅ Recursive Intuition → 🔁 Memoization → 🧮 Tabulation (when applicable)

Every file is commented with:

* Time & Space Complexity 📈
* Intuitive Base Cases and Recurrence Explanation 🧠
* Debug Print Statements (commented) for learning 🪛

## ✨ Motivational Quotes

> "Tree DP is like solving puzzles upside-down — bottom-up recursion builds the complete solution."

> "Never fear recursion. Fear not using it when you should."

> "Think like a tree. Branch out, but always come back to the root."

> "DP isn't just about optimization. It's about recognizing repeated work — and eliminating it like a pro."

> "Every subtree solved is a step toward the whole problem's solution."
